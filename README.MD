## Objectives

The objectives of this project is to have a farmer and a lizard, the farmer has a fixed behavior:

- During the day, he "farms" candy.
- During the afternoon he wanders through the purple zone.
- During night he goes to sleep to his cabin.
- If he sees a lizard (field of view) he will chase it until it lose sight of it (or it hides in the well).

And the lizard has a different behavior:

- It lives in the well
- It has a detection range, if the farmer is inside that range the lizard will flee to it's well.
- During day and afternoon it will go in search of the candy.
- Everytime it eats a candy, it will go back to it's well to "digest" the candy, there it will wait for a moment before going out for more.
- During night it goes to sleep to the well.
- If night arrives and the lizard hasn't eat anything, it will die of starvation.
